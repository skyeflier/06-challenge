# Weather the Weather Wherever

## Description

This project was created because there simply were not enough weather websites out there, and the world needed a simplified version with a fun color scheme, and heavily rounded edges. 

The Weather the Weather Wherever website provides the current and 5-day forecasted weather for any city in the world. To type in a common city name, make sure include the state using this format "city, state". 

The site also saves your search history in the top left corner for easy access to past searches. 

In this project I learned how to integrate API, which was much more challenging that I imagined it would be. I learned a lot about writing different functions and how a more complicated application has a lot of moving parts that need to talk to each other at the right time & place and with proper syntax. 

FUTURE VERSIONS: May include errors if a city name is spelled incorrectly, better date formatting, and improved design. limit the history saved, adjust the temperature and wind speed to be whole digits.
